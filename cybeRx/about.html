	<center><h2>The story of cybeRx begins with a vision by UW Madison Computer Science student Christopher Chu.<br></h2></center>
	<center><img src = "dormpicture.png" id = "dorm"></center>
	<center><br><br><h5>Chris started learning web development as a senior at Arrowhead High School. After taking the class and developing a final project that showcases a website about Mars, <br> Chris decided to take his passion to the next level. He enrolled into the University of Wisconsin as a Badger in 2016 double majoring in computer engineering and computer science. <br> At Arrowhead, he had been working with HTML and CSS languages, but his schooling at UW Madison as well as online coursework through platforms, exposed him in a myraid of<br> skills and languages, such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, iOS Development, Robotics and Javascript/Node.js (which reinforced his skill in web design.) <br>After embarking on 2 self-projects programmed in Swift and Objective-C, Chris decided to finish implementing a viable product of his idea from a Hackathon in March 2018: <br> to utilize Machine Learning APIs and his passion for friendly UI Design to create a one-of-a-kind chatbot to help transition patients and their providers. <br>CyberRx took 3 weeks from the start to end to maximize user experience and provide as much information as possible to potential patients before they see a physician, <br> helping to rapidly accelerate the medical process, both for patient and caretaker.</h5></center>

	<center>When designing the logo, Chris wanted it to be an accurate representation of cybeRx's mission: <br> to maximize user experience and provide as much information as possible to patients
		<br> before they see their physician. He decided a friendly robot that served <br> as a Virtual Assistant would be most suitable. After 20 hours and<br> 5 drafts, the cybeRx logo was born.</center>
